Module 2. Image classification
===============================

The main goal of this Module is to construct a single-date land cover map by classification of a Landsat composite generated from Landsat images. Image classification is frequently used to map land cover, describing what the landscape is composed of (grass, trees, water, impervious surface), and to map land use, describing the organization of human systems on the landscape (farms, cities, wilderness). Learning to do image classification well is extremely important and requires experience. So here is your chance to build some experience. You will first consider the types of land cover classes you would like to map and the amount of variability within each class.

There are both supervised (uses human guidance including training data) and unsupervised (no human guidance) classification methods. The random forest approach used here uses training data and is thus a supervised classification method.

There are a number of supervised classification algorithms that can be used to assign the pixels in the image to the various map classes. One way of performing a supervised classification is to utilize a Machine Learning algorithm. Machine Learning algorithms utilize training data combined with image values to learn how to classify pixels. Using manually collected training data, these algorithms can train a classifier, and then use the relationships identified in the training process to classify the rest of the pixels in the map. The selection of image values (e.g., NDVI, elevation, etc.) used to train any statistical model should be well thought out and informed by your knowledge of the phenomenon of interest to classify your data (e.g., into forest, water, other, and clouds).

In this module, we will create a land cover map using supervised classification in SEPAL. We will train a random forest machine learning algorithm to predict land cover with a user generated reference data set. This data set is collected either in the field or manually through examination of remotely sensed data sources such as aerial imagery. The resulting model is then applied across the landscape. You will complete an accuracy assessment of the map output in Module 4.

Before starting your classification, you will need to create a response design with details about each of the land covers / land uses that you want to classify (Exercise 2.1); create mosaics for your area of interest (in Exercise 2.2 we will use a region of Brazil); and collect training data for the model (Exercise 2.3). Then, in Exercise 2.4 we will run the classification and examine our results.

The workflow in this module has been adapted from exercises and material developed by Dr. Pontus Olofsson, Christopher E. Holden, and Eric L. Bullock at the Boston Education in Earth Observation Data Analysis in the Department of Earth & Environment, Boston University. To learn more about their materials and their work, visit their github site at https://github.com/beeoda.

At the end of this module you will have a classified land use land cover map.

This module takes approximately 4 hours to complete.

-------------------------------------------------
Exercise 2.1. Response design for classification
-------------------------------------------------

Creating consistent labelling protocols is necessary for creating accurate training data and later, accurate sample based estimates (see Module 4). They are especially important when more than one researcher is working on a project and for reproducible data collection. Response design helps a user assign a land cover / land use class to a spatial point. The response design is part of the metadata for the assessment and should contain the information necessary to reproduce the data collection. The response design lays out an objective procedure that interpreters can follow and that reduces interpreter bias.

In this exercise, you will build a decision tree for your classification along with much of the other documentation and decision points that will support the metadata for your classification (for more on decision points, please see Module 5, Exercise 5.1).

Part 1. Specify the classification scheme
------------------------------------------

“Classification scheme” is the name used to describe the land cover and land use classes adopted. It should cover all of the possible classes that occur in the area of interest. Here, you will create a classification scheme with detailed definitions of the land cover and land use classes to share with interpreters.

1. Create a decision tree for your land cover or land use classes. There may be one already in use by your department.  The tree should capture the most important classifications for your study. Here is an example:

  a. This example includes a hierarchical component. For example, the green and red categories have multiple sub-categories, which might be multiple types of forest or crops or urban areas. You can also have classification schemes that are all one level with no hierarchical component.
  b. For this Exercise, we’ll use a simplified land cover and land use classification as in the second image:

   :align: center


.. figure:: images/classification_scheme.png
   :alt: The classification scheme we will use for this exercise, with two classes forest and non-forest
   :width: 450
   :align: center



2. When creating your own decision tree, be sure to specify if your classification scheme was derived from a template, including the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) land-use categories, CLC (CORINE land cover), or LUCAS (land cover and land use, landscape).

  a. If applicable, your classification scheme should be consistent with the national land cover and land use definitions.
  b. In cases where the classification scheme definition is different from the national definition, you will need to provide a reason.

3. Create a detailed definition for each land cover and land use and change class included in the classification scheme. We recommend you include measurable thresholds.

  a. Our classification will take place in Brazil, in an area of the Amazon rainforest undergoing deforestation.

    i. We’ll define Forest as an area with over 70% tree cover.
    ii. We’ll define Non-forest as areas with less than 70% tree cover. This will capture urban areas, water, and agricultural fields.

  b. For creating your own classifications, here’s some things to keep in mind:

    i. It is important to have definitions for each of the classes. A lack of clear definitions of the land cover classes can make the quality of the resulting maps difficult to assess, and challenging for others to use. The definitions you come up with now will probably be working definitions that you find you need to modify as you move through the land cover classification process.

       As you become more familiar with the landscape, data limitations, and the ability of the land cover classification methods to discriminate some classes better than others, you will undoubtedly need to update your definitions.

    ii. As you develop your definitions, you should be relating back to your applications. Make sure that your definitions meet your project objectives. For example, if you are creating a map to be used as part of your UNFCCC greenhouse gas reporting documents you will need to make sure that your definition of forest meets the needs of this application.

        The above land cover tree is an excerpt of text from the Methods and Guidance from the Global Forest Observations Initiative (GFOI) document that describes the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2003 Good Practice Guidance (GPG) forest definition and suggestions to consider when drafting your forest definition. When creating your own decision tree, be sure to specify if your definitions follow a specific standard, e.g., using ISO standard Land Cover Meta-Language (LCML, ISO 19144-2) or similar.

    iii. During this online training course, you will be mapping land cover across the landscape using the Landsat composite, a moderate resolution data set. You may develop definitions based upon your knowledge from the field or from investigating high resolution imagery. However, when deriving your land cover class definitions, it’s also important to be aware of how the definitions relate to the data used to model the land cover.

         You will continue to explore this relationship throughout the exercise. Will the spectral signatures between your land cover categories differ? If the spectral signatures are not substantially different between classes, is there additional data you can use to differentiate these categories? If not, you might consider modifying your definitions.

Exercise 2.2. Create a mosaic for classification
-------------------------------------------------

We first need an image to classify before running a classification. For best results, we will need to create an optical mosaic with good coverage of our study area. We will build on knowledge gained in Module 1 to create an optical mosaic in SEPAL and retrieve it to Google Earth Engine.

In SEPAL you can run a classification on either a mosaic recipe or on a GEE asset. It is best practice to run a classification using an asset rather than on-the-fly with a recipe. This will improve how quickly your classification will export and avoid computational limitations.

+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

Part 1. Creating and exporting a mosaic for a drawn AOI
--------------------------------------------------------

We will create a mosaic for an area in the Amazon basin. If any of the steps for creating a mosaic are unfamiliar, please revisit Module 1, particularly Exercise 1.2.

1. Navigate to the Process tab, then create a new optical mosaic by selecting Optical Mosaic on the Process menu.
2. Under **Area of Interest:**

  a. Select **Draw Polygon** from the dropdown list.

  .. figure:: images/aoi_dropdown.png
     :alt: Area of interest dropdown menu.
     :width: 450
     :align: center

  b. Navigate using the map to the State of Rondonia (Brazil) and either draw a polygon around it or draw a polygon within the borders. A smaller polygon will export faster.

.. figure:: images/rondonia.png
   :alt: A polygon drawn around the State of Rondonia.
   :align: center

3. Now use what you have learned in Module 1 to create a mosaic with imagery from the year 2019 (whole year or part of year, your choice). Don’t forget to consider which satellites you would like to include and which scenes you would like to include (all, some).
4. Your preview should include imagery data across your entire area of interest. This is important for your classification. Try also to get a cloud-free mosaic, as this makes your classification easier.
5. Name your mosaic for easy retrieval. Try “Module2_Amazon”.
6. When you’re satisfied with your mosaic, **Retrieve** it to Google Earth Engine. Be sure to include the red, green, blue, nir, swir1, and swir2 layers. You may choose to add the greenness, etc. layers as well.



Part 2. Finding your Earth Engine Asset
----------------------------------------

For future exercises, you may need to know how to find your Earth Engine Asset.

1. Navigate to https://code.earthengine.google.com/ and login.
2. Navigate to your **Assets** tab in the left hand column.
3. Under **Assets,** look for the name of the mosaic you just exported.
4. Click on the mosaic name.
5. You will see a window with information about your mosaic pop up.
6. Click on the two overlapping box icon to copy your asset’s location.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 2.3. Creating a classification & training data collection
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, we will learn how to start a classification process and collect training data. These training data points will become the foundation of the classification in Exercise 2.4. High quality training data is necessary to get good land cover map results. In the most ideal situation, training data is collected in the field by visiting each of the land cover types to be mapped and collecting attributes. When field collection is not an option, the second best choice is to digitize training data from high resolution imagery, or at the very least for the imagery to be classified.

In general, there are multiple pathways for collecting training data. Using desktop GIS, including QGIS and ArcGIS, to create a layer of points is one common approach. Using GEE is another approach. You can also use CEO to create a project of random points to identify (see detailed directions in Module 4.1 Part 2). All of these pathways will create .csv or an GEE table that you can import into SEPAL to use as your training data set.

However, SEPAL has a built-in reference data collection tool in the classifier. In this exercise, we will use this tool to collect training data. Even if you use a .csv or GEE table in the future, this is a helpful feature to collect additional training data points to help refine your model.

In this assignment, you will create training data points using high-resolution imagery, including Planet NICFI data. These will be used to train the classifier in a supervised classification using SEPAL’s random forests algorithm. The goal of training the classifier is to provide examples of the variety of spectral signatures associated with each class in the map.

+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------+

Part 1. Set up your classification
-----------------------------------

1. In the **Process** menu, click the green plus symbol and select **Classification.**
2. Add the Amazon optical mosaic for classification:

  a. Click **+ Add** and choose either **Saved Sepal Recipe** or **Earth Engine Asset** (recommended).

    i. If you choose **Saved Sepal Recipe**, simply select your Module 2 Amazon recipe.
    ii. If you choose **Earth Engine Asset**, enter the Earth Engine Asset ID for the mosaic. The ID should look like “users/username/Module2_Amazon”.

        Remember that you can find the link to your Earth Engine Asset ID via Google Earth Engine’s Asset tab (see Exercise 2.2 Part 2).

  b. Select bands: Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, & SWIR2. You can add other bands as well if you included them in your mosaic.
  c. You can also include **Derived bands** by clicking on the green button on the lower left.
  d. Click **Apply,** then click **Next.**

.. warning::
   Selecting **Saved Sepal Recipe** may cause an error stating "Google Earth Engine error: Failed to create preview" at the final stage of your classification. This occurs because GEE gets overloaded. If you encounter this error, please retrieve your classification as described in Exercise 2.2.

3. In the Legend menu, click **+ Add** This will add a place for you to write your first class label.

  a. You will need two legend entries.
  b. The first should have the number 1 and a Class label of Forest.
  c. The second should have the number 2 and a Class  label of Non-forest.
  d. Choose colors for each class as you see fit.
  e. Click **Done**.

Part 2. Collect training data points
-------------------------------------

Now that you have created your classification, you are ready to begin collecting data points for each land cover class.

In most cases, it is ideal to collect a large amount of training data points for each class that capture the variability within each class and cover the different areas of the study area. However, for this exercise, you will only collect a small number of points: around 25 per class. When collecting data points, make sure that your plot contains only the land cover class of interest (no plots with a mixture of your land cover categories).

Not all pixels in the same classes have the exact same values—there is some natural variability! Capturing this variation will strongly influence the results of your classification.

1. First, let’s become familiar with the SEPAL Interface.
2. In the upper right corner of the map is a stack of three rectangles. If you mouse over this icon, it says "Select layers to show."

   Available base layers include SEPAL (Minimal dark Sepal default layer), Google Satellite, and Planet NICFI composites.

  a. We will use the Planet NICFI composites for this example. The composites are available in either RGB or false color infrared (CIR). Composites are available monthly after September 2020 and for every 6 months prior back till 2015.
  b. Select RGB, Jun 2019 (6 months).
  c. You can also select "Show labels" to enable labels that can help you orient yourself in the landscape.

.. figure:: images/layer_view.png
   :alt: The layers available.
   :align: center



3. Now click on the point icon. When you mouse over this icon, it says "Enable reference data collection."
4. With reference data collection enabled, you can start adding points to your map.
5. Use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom in to the study area. You can click-hold and drag to pan around the map. Be careful though, as a single click will place a point on the map.

   If you accidentally add a point, you can delete it by clicking on the red **Remove** button.

6. Now we will start collecting forest training data.

  a. Zoom into an area that is clearly forested. When you find an area that is completely forested, click it once.
  b. You have just placed a training data point!
  c. Click the **Forest** button in the training data interface to classify the point.

     If you haven’t classified the point yet, then you can just click somewhere else on the map instead of deleting the record.

.. figure:: images/collecting_forest_data.png
   :alt: Collecting forest data in the SEPAL interface.
   :align: center



.. note::
   Ideally you should switch back to the Landsat mosaic to make sure that this forested area is not covered with a cloud. If you mistakenly classify a cloudy pixel as Forest, then the results will be impacted negatively if your Landsat mosaic does have cloud-covered areas.

   However, this interface does not allow for switching between the Base Layer imagery and your exported mosaic. If you are using another training data collection method, keep this point in mind.

7. If you need to modify classification of any of your data points, you can click on the point to return to the classification (or delete) options.
8. Begin collecting the rest of the 25 **Forest** training data points throughout other parts of the study area.

  a. The study area contains an abundance of forested land, so it should be pretty easy to identify places that can be confidently classified as forest. If you’d like, use the charts function to ensure that there is a relatively high NDVI value for the point.
  b. Ensure you are placing data points within the extent of the mosaic (Rondonia).

9. Collect about 25 points for the **Forest** land cover class.

   When you are done, zoom out to the full extent of the area. Did you place data points somewhat equally across the full region? Are all points clustered in the same region? It’s best to make sure you have data points covering the full spatial extent of the study region, add more points in areas that are sparsely represented if needed.

10. After you collect your training data for **Forest**, you may see the classification preview appear.

  a. To disable the classification preview to continue to collect training data, return to the map layer selector.
  b. Uncheck the "Classification" Overlay.

.. figure:: images/classification_overlay.png
   :alt: Disabling the classification overlay.
   :width: 450
   :align: center

11. Once you are satisfied with your forested training data points, move on to the **Non-Forest** training points.

  a. Since we are using a very basic set of land cover classes for this exercise, this should include agricultural areas, water, and buildings and roads. Therefore, it will be important that you focus on collecting a variety of points from different types of land cover throughout the study area.
  b. **Water** is one of the easiest classes to identify and the easiest to model, due to the distinct spectral signature of water.

    i. Look for water bodies within Rondonia.
    ii. Collect 10-15 data points for Water and be sure to spread them throughout the lakes and rivers of Rondonia.
    iii. Some wetland areas may have varying amounts of water throughout the year, so it is important to check both Planet NICFI maps for 2019. (Jun 2019 and Dec 2019).

.. figure:: images/data_points_water.png
   :alt: Collecting data points in water.
   :align: center



12. Let’s now collect some building and road non-forest Training Data.

  a. There are not very many residential areas in the region. However, if you look you can find homes with dirt roads, and there are some airports as well.
  b. Place a point or points within these areas and classify them as Non-forest. Do your best to avoid placing the points over areas of the town with lots of trees.
  c. Find some roads, and place points and classify as Non-forest. These may look like areas of bare soil. Both bare soil and roads are classified as Non-forest, so place some points on both.

.. figure:: images/data_points_residential.png
   :alt: Collecting residential and other human settlement area data points.
   :align: center



13. Next, place several points in grassland/pasture, shrub, and agricultural areas around the study area.

  a. Shrubs or small, non-forest vegetation can sometimes be hard to identify, even with high-resolution imagery. Do your best to find vegetation that is clearly not forest.
  b. The texture of the vegetation is one of the best ways to differentiate between trees and grasses/shrubs. Look at the below image and notice the clear contrast between the area where the points are placed and the other areas in the image that have rougher textures and that create shadows.

.. figure:: images/data_points_low_vegetation.png
   :alt: Collecting low vegetation data
   :align: center



.. note::
   If you are using QGIS etc. to collect training data, you should also collect **cloud** training data in the **Non-forest** class, if your Landsat has any clouds. If there are some clouds that were not removed during the Landsat mosaic creation process you will need to create training data for the clouds that remain so that the classifier knows what those pixels represent. Sometimes clouds were detected during the mosaic process and were mostly removed. However, you can see some of the edges of those clouds remain.

   Note that you may not have any clouds in your Landsat imagery.

14. Continue collecting Non-forest points. Again, be sure to spread the points out across the study area.
15. Once again when you are done collecting data for these categories, zoom out to the full extent of the study region.

  a. Did you place data points somewhat equally across the full region?
  b. Are all points clustered in the same area?
  c. It’s best to make sure you have data points covering the full spatial extent of the study region, add more points in areas that are sparsely represented if needed.

Exercise 2.4. Classification using machine learning algorithms (Random Forests) in SEPAL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



.. figure:: images/random_forest_model_outcome.png
   :alt: The outcome of a random forest model.
   :align: center



As mentioned in the Module introduction, the classification algorithm you will be using today is called random forest.  The random forest algorithm creates numerous decision trees for each pixel. Each of these decision trees votes on what the pixel should be classified as. The land cover class that receives the most votes is then assigned as the map class for that pixel. Random forests are efficient on large data and accurate when compared to other classification algorithms.

To complete the classification of our mosaicked image you are going to use a random forests classifier contained within the easy-to-use Classification tool in SEPAL. The image values used to train the model include the Landsat mosaic values and some derivatives, if selected (such as NDVI). There are likely additional data sets that can be used to help differentiate land cover classes, such as elevation data.

After we create the map, you might find that there are some areas that are not classifying well. The classification process is iterative, and there are ways you can modify the process to get better results. One way is to collect more or better reference data to train the model. You can test different classification algorithms, or explore object based approaches opposed to pixel based approaches. The possibilities are many and should relate back to the nature of the classes you hope to map. Last but certainly not least is to improve the quality of your training data. Be sure to log all of these decision points in order to recreate your analysis in the future.

  c. Additional parameters for each of these can be specified by clicking on the **More** button in the lower left.
  d. For this example, we will use the default random forest with 25 trees.

3. If you turned off your classification preview previously to collect training data, now is the time to turn it back on.

  a. Click on the "Select layers to show" icon.
  b. Select "Classification"
  c. Make sure Classification now has a check mark next to it, indicating that the layer is now turned on.

4. Now we’ll save our classification output.

  a. First, rename your classification by typing a new name in the tab.
  b. Click **Retrieve classification** in the upper right hand corner (cloud icon).
  c. Choose 30 m resolution.
  d. Select the Class, Class probability, Forest % and Non-forest % bands.
  e. Retrieve to your **SEPAL Workspace.**

     You can also choose **Google Earth Engine Asset** if you would like to be able to share your results or perform additional analysis in GEE. However with this option, you will need to download your map from GEE using the Export function.

  f. Once the download begins, you will see the spinning wheel in the bottom left of the webpage in **Tasks.** Click the spinning wheel to observe the progress of your export.
  g. When complete, if you chose SEPAL workspace, the file will be in your SEPAL downloads folder. (Browse > downloads > classification name folder). If you chose GEE Asset the file will be in your GEE Assets.

Part 2. QA/QC considerations and methods
-----------------------------------------

Quality assurance and quality control, commonly referred to as QA/QC, is a critical part of any analysis. There are two approaches to QA/QC: formal and informal. Formal QA/QC, specifically sample-based estimates of error and area are described in Module 4. Informal QA/QC involves qualitative approaches to identifying problems with your analysis and classifications to iterate and create improved classifications. Here we’ll discuss one approach to informal QA/QC.

Following analysis you should spend some time looking at your land cover classification map in order to understand if the results make sense. We’ll do this in the classification window. This allows us to visualize the data and collect additional training points if we find areas of poor classification. Other approaches not covered here include visualizing the data in Google Earth Engine or in another program, such as QGIS or ArcMAP.

With SEPAL you can examine your classification and collect additional training data to improve the classification.

1. Turn on the imagery for your Classification and pan and zoom around the map.
2. Compare your Classification map to the 2015 and 2020 imagery. Where do you see areas that are correct? Where do you see areas that are incorrect?
3. If your results make sense, and you are happy with them, great! Go on to the formal QA/QC in Module 4.
4. However, if you are not satisfied, collect additional points of training data where you see inaccuracies. Then re-export the classification following the steps in Part 3.

**Congratulations! You now know how to produce map classifications in SEPAL.**
