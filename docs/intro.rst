Introduction
=============

In this document, you will learn how to explore agreement between interpreters. This is specifically targeted towards land cover and land use classification assessment efforts where multiple interpreters are collecting either training data or validation data. The goal of this manual is to teach you how to perform these tasks such that you can conduct your own assessment.

There are three exercises, each describing a different aspect of determining agreement in interpretation data.

1. Calculating agreement between interpreters
2. Identifying plots with poor agreement between interpreters
3. Calculating agreement within classes (e.g. land cover classes)

These exercises include step-by-step directions and are built to facilitate learning through reading and by doing.

This assumes that you have downloaded all of your interpretation results, for example from Collect Earth Online. Our primary tool for this material is Microsoft Excel.

Collect Earth Online (CEO), is a free and open-source image viewing and interpretation tool, suitable for projects requiring information about land cover and/or land use. CEO enables simultaneous visual interpretations of satellite imagery, providing global coverage from MapBox and Bing Maps, a variety of satellite data sources from Google Earth Engine, and the ability to connect to your own Web Map Service (WMS) or Web Map Tile Service (WMTS). The full functionality is implemented online, no desktop installation is necessary. CEO allows institutions to create projects and leverage their teams to collect spatial data using remote sensing imagery. Use cases include historical and near-real-time interpretation of satellite imagery and data collection for land cover/land use model validation.
